// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

// The correct order would be as follows.
/*  Planning
    Analysis of Requirements
    Design
    Implementation
    Testing & Integration
    Maintain
/*


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirement = "Analysis of Requirements is where it is determend what needs to happen for the gole to be accomplished. Example what technolagies need to be used, how to use them to accomplish the end goal, and so on."
const design = "Design is where it is figured out how to implement the requirements. Such as how or when to use determend technologies. What to use for front end, the back end, how to structure it and so on.
const implementation = "Implementation is when the work to accomplish Planning, Requirements, and Design are started and finished."
